                    <p>
                    Cornell ChemE Car is a happy family housed in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering but open of anyone who wants to join.
                    Below, we detail some general information about the team and the competition.
                    For our contact information, please scroll towards the bottom of this page.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>Team history</h2>
                 	 <p>
                        Lying around the car team lab are the remnants of cars past. Based on extensive archeological work, we have hypothesized the following:
                        At one time, there was a car powered by some sort of homemade battery. It used two sewing boxes to separate multiple cells (~16).
                        Copper wire was involved (maybe as the anode? cathode?). The power generated by these batteries was then used to drive an electric motor (specifications unknown).
                        The chassis was built of wood, and rollerblade wheels were used.
                        We found what we believe to be the remains of some sort of air-motor powered car.
                        However, the few fragments remaining make it difficult to guess as to the design and function of the car.
                        There exists the body of some sort of remote control car.
                        It has a neat suspension system which, we hypothesize, allowed it to travel over bumps with relative ease. Little else is known about the car.
                    </p>
      
                    <h2>What is ChemE Car?</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                    ChemE Car is an annual competition sponsored by American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AlChE).
                    The goal of the competition is to build a chemically-powered car (roughly the size of a shoebox) which can travel 50-100 ft while carrying a water payload of 0-500 mL.
                    Each spring, AIChE holds nine regional conferences. The top three winners move on to compete in the national competition held in the Fall.
                    Cornell competes in the Northeast region against RPI, Northeastern University, University of Maine, etc.
                    <p>
                        
               <h2>How does the competition work?</h2>
               
               <p>
                For a comprehensive explanation of the competition rules, please refer you to AIChE's official competition rules.
                The main rules are highlighted below:
               </p>
               <p>
               Let's begin with the physical constraints of the car. 
               </p>
               <p>
               When disassembled, the car must be able to fit into a 40 cm by 30 cm by 18 cm box.
               It must be capable of safely holding up to 500 mL of water. 
               </p>
               <p>
                In addition, the car must be powered by chemical reactions only, and should cost no more than $2,000.
                <img src="http://www.rso.cornell.edu/chemecar/images/photos/R119.jpg" style="height:200px; padding: 15px 0px 15px 20px" align="right">
                Kits (a common fuel cell car) cannot be used without extensive modification and commercial batteries are not allowed.
                More importantly, the car cannot have any brakes or other mechanical/electronic stopping devices.
                There will be a poster session prior to each competition and a panel of judges will inspect the car.
                Safety is the primary concern of these inspections, but there will be opportunities to discuss novel design features of the car, environmental and safety features, etc.
                Teams must score at least 70 out of 100 in the poster session to be allowed to race.
               </p>
               <p>THE COMPETITION</p>
               <p>
                The competition is held on a course which can be anywhere from 50 to 100 feet in length. At the beginning of the competition, the judges will announce the distance and water payload (0-500 mL).
                There are two rounds in the competition.
                                <img src="http://www.rso.cornell.edu/chemecar/images/thumbnails/N122.jpg" style="height:150px; margin: 15px 20px 10px 5px" align="left">

                The order of the first race is determined by teams' score during the poster session.
                The order of the second round is determined by performance during the first round. The higher your score in the first round (that is, the closer you are to the target line), the later in round two you will go.               
                An extremely important rule during the race is as follows: when the announcer calls start, a car must start moving, traverse the distance, and come to a complete stop within two minutes.
                This rule has been the bane of many excellent cars, which just kept going, and going, and going, and going...
                A word on safety: in recent years, due to some publicized accidents, AIChE has made safety the prime focus of the competition.
                Each team is required to submit a Job Safety Analysis (JSA) months ahead of the competition, detailing the safety aspects of the car. Also, almost all car disqualifications at the competitions are due to safety violations.
                Take safety seriously.
               </p>

                We are a team of dedicated researchers looking to push the boundaries of battery technology. Our members are looking at ways of applying chemical engineering principles to control different aspects of the cathode and anode fabrication with the hopes of achieving a high efficiency and high capacity battery. Current interests are focused in the lithium ion field with special focus on layered spinels. In the coming year, we hope to construct a battery with an optimized anode and cathode and examine the effects of different configurations on cell capacity and discharge rate. We may also look into rechargeable aluminum batteries, but are going to need some outside consultation first. Overall, we are an innovative team seeking to gain high level technical skills.

			<p>	    
			    After two years of zinc and carbon based batteries, we are currently researching other batteries, namely lithium-ion batteries, to use at the next competition.

			<span>Fuel</span>
			<br>
			In it's current iteration, the Fuel Cell group hopes to build upon the success of Bender 4.0, our first ever Nationals winner.
			We have a fresh team with brand new ideas that is building a car from the ground.
			Our goal is to design an efficient storage and delivery process for ultra high purity hydrogen to power a PEM fuel cell.
			The basic setup includes a small aluminum vessel for hydrogen storage at low pressure, safety valves, and a 20W 13-Cell fuel stack.
			</p>
			<p>
			The team is designing an improved manifold to host our valves and regulators.
			Our focus on safety in designs has led to the inclusion of pressure relief valves along with two-stage regulators to ensure smooth hydrogen flow across fuel stacks.
			We also plan to translate our plans into 3-D AutoCad templates to aid the design of a fully machined chassis.
			Lastly, we aim to add a series of power regulators and electronic flow gauges to monitor our car's performance during both calibration and competition runs.
			We have set our sights on winning Regionals 2012 and then it will be off to Pittsburgh for the real challenge!

			<span>Potions</span>
			<br>

			The potions subteam is responsible for controlling the stopping mechanism of our Chemical Engineering Car. Through the Iodine Clock Reaction, we are able to accurately and precisely control the time at which our car will stop moving by integrating a light sensor and circuit. By calibrating our reaction during weekly time trials and during the competition, we can quickly, accurately, and efficiently judge the ratios of our chemicals before we initiate the reaction at the starting line. During our weekly meetings, members will learn about the reaction and its kinetics, help construct calibration curves, and participate in weekly wet-lab competitions judges on accuracy.

			<p>
			    <span>Mechanical</span>
			    <br>
			Previously called Chassis, the Mechanical team works on all things mechanical that comes with the ChemE Car competition. The team works with power teams to design and build the housing for the power source and chassis for the various equipments and loads. In addition, the team develops a drivetrain and motor-gear system to convert the power source into mechanical energy. Simultaneously, members are actively participating in research and development regarding new chassis materials, motors, wheels etc.

			    <span>Safety</span>
			    <br>
			    The ChemE Car Safety Sub-Team is a group of team members who are responsible for overseeing and enforcing all safety policies and procedures associated with the team. This involves appropriately identifying hazards and risks that are associated with procedures, materials and/or processes being carried out by the team. The Safety Team is responsible for taking action to minimize or completely eliminate all identified risks and/or hazards. We are also the authors of the Engineering Documentation Packages for each competition we attend and actively participate on all power sub-teams.
			    So far this semester, the Safety Team has completed the EDP (Engineering Documentation Package) and made sure that car safety and personal protective equipment are up to standards for Nationals.
			    At the previous national competition, we passed the safety inspection and learned about the safety of different types of cars in order to prepare for the intrasquad ChemE Car Competition.
			    </p>
			    <p>
			    The team as a whole is responsible for ensuring that lab safety is maintained at all times. We make sure that the working conditions are safe and in conjunction with OSHA guidelines and Cornell policies.
			    In addition, all reactions considered as part of the car designs must be approved by the Safety team.

            <p>
            <span>Pressure</span>
            <br>
            The pressure team uses chemical reactions to generate pressure. More specifically, we mix aqueous citric acid and sodium bicarbonate to produce carbon dioxide which we store as pressure in our pressure vessel. This pressure is then regulated downstream through a pressure regulator before finally reaching the motor to power our car. We are currently in the development phase of our car, and our goal is to create and build a moving car by the time this semester ends.

                <span>Thermo-electric Generation</span>
                <br>
                We are the thermo-electric generation team. As our name implies, this sub-team exploits heat to generate electricity to ultimately drive out chemE car. We are a new team formed spring 2013 and looking to develop a robust and consistent way to power the car in a safe and clean chemical reaction. This semester we will be doing much research and development around finding a consistent heat sources for power.

            <p>
                <span>Electronics</span>
                <br>
                The electronics team consists of mainly ECE and CS majors, but anyone who wants to learn circuits is welcome.  The whole team interacts with many of the power subteams - battery, fuel cell, pressure, TEG, and bio - to respond effectively to their needs as well as bond with non-ECE/CS people.  The electronics team is currently working with microcontrollers to improve the calibrations of the cars by collecting data about the speed and transmitting it through bluetooth to a computer.  In addition to working with microcontrollers, the team of course plays around with circuits.  We design circuits tailored to each power subteam car on breadboard, and once everything is finalized, we design a small, compact PCB (printed circuit board) to be put on the cars for competition.  

                Lastly, we are always trying to create new stopping mechanisms for other power subteams since each power source operates differently.  Our main stopping mechanism circuit used is with the iodine clock reaction where there is a light shining through the potions chamber reaching a photoresistor on the other.  Once the iodine clock reaction is completed, the whole solution turns blue-black, drastically decreasing the amount of light shining on the photoresistor.  This in turn signals the circuit to cut off power to the motor, stopping the car.

                <br>
                The Biological Systems Subteam is primarily a research and development team. Current focus is on identifying and optimizing biologically sourced chemical reactions which can power a competition car. Current projects study the potential for gas-producing reactions to generate large pressure gradients. The team is currently working with O2-generating catalase systems, as well as CO2-generating yeast systems. Weekly tasks involve research deliverables as well as wet-lab work.

                        The Cornell ChemE Car Team has high visibility in the chemical engineering domain due to our appearances and achievements in the regional, national and international competitions.
                        We can harness this visibility to promote your company at the competitions as well as in Cornell University.
                        We have received extensive coverage in AIChEs Chemical Engineering Progress (AIChE CEP) magazine and were featured on AIChEs ChEnected website for chemical engineering professionals. Cornell-based publications like the Cornell Chronicle and the Cornell Daily Sun have also drawn attention to our victories.
                        Your honored sponsorship would increase the exposure your company has, which could translate into greater recruitment opportunities.
                        In our sponsorship packet you will find detailed information about the Team and how sponsors can receive the maximum benefits and exposures.
                        </p>
